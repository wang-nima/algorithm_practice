files open for update (those which include a "+" sign), on which both input and output operations are allowed, the stream shall be flushed (fflush) or repositioned (fseek, fsetpos, rewind) before a reading operation that follows a writing operation. The stream shall be repositioned (fseek, fsetpos, rewind) before a writing operation that follows a reading operation (whenever that operation did not reach the end-of-file).

Return Value
If the file is successfully opened, the function returns a pointer to a FILE object that can be used to identify the stream on future operations.
Otherwise, a null pointer is returned.
On most library implementations, the errno variable is also set to a system-specific error code on failure.
